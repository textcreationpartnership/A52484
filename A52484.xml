            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>NORWICH</hi> and <hi>NORFOLK</hi> Weavers ANSWER to the PETITION and CASE of the Wool-Combers; Humbly offered to the Conſideration of the Parliament.</head>
            <p>SOME Wool-Combers in <hi>Suffolk</hi> and parts adjacent, being notoriouſly known to make falſe and defective Yarn, and having ſometimes deſervedly ſuffered for ſuch their Offences, who being uneaſie under the ſame, as it's common for all Offenders ſo to be, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very induſtrious to obtain ſuch an Alteration in the Law, as that they may for the future make and vend their defective Yarn unmoleſted; and in order to that end have preſented a Petition to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, and printed a Caſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of great Hardſhips and unjuſt Proſecutions againſt them by the Wardens and Aſſiſtants of the Company of Weavers.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding their Complaints are for the moſt part falſe, malicious, and unreaſonable, and delivered in abuſive and skurrulous Language, with odious Compariſons, yet we think it not proper to Reply in ſuch a Dialect, but ſhall only give a modeſt and true Anſwer to the moſt material Parts of their Petition and Caſe, which is humbly ſubmitted to conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Petition and Caſe ſets forth, <hi>That whereas the Weavers of the City of</hi> Norwich <hi>and County of</hi> Norfolk <hi>obtained an Act of Parliament the Fourteenth Year of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second, whereby they are impowered to ſearch and ſeize all Worsted Yarn Reeled ſhort or falſe, in all Fairs, Markets, and other Publick places of Sale in the City and County of</hi> Norwich <hi>and</hi> Norfolk: <hi>And to lay a Fine upon ſuch Yarn ſo defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive as a Jury ſhall find, not exceeding a Moiety thereof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But that contrary to the very Letter of the Law (though under pretext thereof) they have made great ſpoil of the Wool-Combers, by ſeizing and rifling the Waggons of common Carriers, and breaking open private Chambers and Ware-houſes, with divers other exorbitant proceedings; That the Exactions of the Wardens (who are both Searcher, Seizer, Judge and Jury) are ſwallowed up in unneceſſary Charges, or conſumed riotouſly in Treats: To prevent which, they humbly pray and propoſe,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Wool-Combers may be impowered to puniſh the Spinſter by ſome Corporal Infliction or Penalty for making falſe Yarns.</p>
            <p>That if any Yarn be found defective, then inſtead of laying a Fine thereupon, the ſame may be cut in pieces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which it is anſwered;</p>
            <p>That the Company of Wardens and Aſſiſtants have all along taken great care to act according to the Powers granted them by the ſaid Act of Parliament, and have rather been too remiſs than ſevere in Proſecuting Offenders.</p>
            <p>That there are yearly choſen 42 Wardens and Aſſiſtants, and if at any time any particular Officer hath, through Miſtake, Ignorance, or too much Zeal to remedy the Abuſes and Evils by the ſaid Act intended to be redreſſed, ſeized any defective Yarns in any place, where according to the Letter of the Law the ſame was not ſeizable, ſuch Actions have not been allowed of by the Company, and therefore (it's hoped) ought not to be charged upon them as a Crime.</p>
            <p>That the Moneys ariſing by the Fines of defective Yarns, (which Yarns have not been condemned by the Wardens, as is falſly ſuggeſted) have not been conſumed in unneceſſary Charges, or riotouſly in Treats, but have been applied as the Law directs.</p>
            <p>That many of the Wool-combers have uſed indirect means to avoid the Wardens ſearch, by coming to <hi>Norwich</hi> ſometimes upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, ſometimes in the Night, and by conveying their Yarn into private places, and there ſelling it to the great prejudice of all honeſt Traders: And therefore the Weavers, and all regular Wool-combers, have much greater reaſon to complain againſt ſuch Practices, and pray that the Power of Search may be inlarged.</p>
            <p>As to the inflicting a Corporal Puniſhment or Penalty upon the Spinſter,</p>
            <p>It's anſwered, That the Weavers are well content that a Puniſhment or Penalty may be inflicted upon the Spinſter who ſhall make falſe Yarn; and are alſo deſirous, and think it as reaſonable and neceſſary, that a Puniſhment or Penalty may be inflicted upon the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comber who ſhall tollerate, or knowingly allow or ſuffer them ſo to do, which hath been a practice too much uſed by many of them of late years.</p>
            <p>As to the cutting of Yarns in pieces,</p>
            <p>It's anſwered, That the Method was formerly uſed, but found ſo inconvenient; that when the laſt Act was made, it was thought fit by the Wiſdom of that Parliament, that it ſhould be turned into a Fine.</p>
            <p>That for above Thirty years Experience the Method now uſed in fining defective Yarns hath been found to be of great ſervice and benefit to the Weaving Trade, which has of late years been very much increaſed, to the great benefit and advantage of this Nation, and more eſpecially to the clamorous Wool-combers.</p>
            <p>That if any Wool-combers are deſirous to have defective Yarn cut in pieces, they may now do it, and it will moſt properly be done by them at their Spinning-Houſes before the Spinſters Faces, which may be a great means to deter them from making falſe Yarn for the future.</p>
            <p>That the true Reaſon why the Petitioners are ſo induſtrious to obtain ſuch a deſtructive Act (as we have great cauſe to believe) is the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they have, That if the Law be once made ſo ſevere, and there be nothing allowed towards the defraying the neceſſary Charges of Proſecution, or ſo oft as there be a great demand for Yarn, that thereupon the Proſecution will in a great meaſure, if not wholly ceaſe, and then they ſhould be at liberty to make and vend their defective Yarns unmoleſted, to the great prejudice, if not ruin of ſo ancient and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial a Trade as the Worſtead-weaving Trade has been, and is to this Nation. And ſhould that Trade fail the Wool-growers would ſoon find the ill effects thereof.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is objected, <hi>That it would be to the ruin of the Wool-combers, their Wives and Children, to ſtand a Suit at Law againſt the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens when they ſeize their Yarns contrary to Law,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's anſwered, That the Wool-combers aſſert that they are above 500 ſubſtantial Traders who imploy 150000 Families, and it ſeems very ſtrange that the Proſecution of a Warden or Aſſiſtant, if he acts contrary to Law, ſhould be to their ruin.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay (by way of aggravation) <hi>That where many of them pay One ſhilling Tax toward the Support of the Government, they pay Five to the Wardens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's anſwered, That there hath not for Eight years laſt paſt been above 120 <hi>l.</hi> one Year with the other received for all the Fines of defective Yarns, which is a very inconſiderable Sum, conſidering the vaſt quantity of Yarns that muſt be made by 500 ſubſtantial Traders who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy 150000 Families.</p>
            <p>That according to a modeſt computation the Yarns uſed by the Weavers fall ſhort of what they would be worth, if made as the Law directs, at leaſt 25000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which is chiefly occaſioned by the want of a greater Power to Search, and therefore it's hoped it will not be unreaſonable that the Power of Search ſhould be inlarged.</p>
            <p>And whereas they ſay, <hi>That ſome Weavers would ſerve the Office of a Warden</hi> gratis <hi>without coſtly Treats, voluptuous Banquets, or other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantages,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's anſwered, That all the Wardens and Aſſiſtants do ſerve without any reward for their great pains and troubles, other then the neceſſary and reaſonable Charges and Expence upon that account, of which they give an exact account, which is allowed by the Juſtices of the Peace, <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 letter">
